# MED7334 Narrative on the MA in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University

This repo contains resources for students on the [MA Data Journalism](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism) at Birmingham City University. The course module in Narrative covers a range of techniques for telling data stories across text, video and audio, visual and interactive forms, and web, chat and social platforms.

Most resources for the module can be found in the [Narrative Moodle website](https://moodle.bcu.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=94115). This repo contains extra resources and activities specific to data journalism.

## Module Synopsis

Narrative: from media to interactive media aims to give you the skills to critically adapt to both new and existing storytelling formats and platforms. 

We begin by introducing basic narrative concepts that can be used to get to grips with any format you might need, or want, to work in. Then we look at specific formats, from writing for the web, and online and social video, to visualisation and interactivity. By the end of the module you should be able to identify how to approach a specific story across different platforms - and you'll be telling one story in three different formats.

## Week by week outline

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.
